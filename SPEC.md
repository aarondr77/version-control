Thinking about how we can do structure difference. Let's think about the following two basic types:

Primitive Types:
    - Boolean
    - Integer
    - Char
    - String

List: 
    - Contains a single type
    - Can add a line with some element of the list type
        - Operation is line_number X element_data
    - Can remove a line
        - Operation is line_number

Dictonary:
    - Can add a key
        - Operation is key X value
        - Note that this might be an insert or a change key
    - Can remove a key
        - Operation is key



Assume we are given some object. We assume that the object has a name. We are given an old version of this object and a new version of this object. 

If the object is a Primitive type:
    - return ChangePrimitive: name X new_value

if the object is a List:
    - Get the LCS indexes between the old list and the new list
    - 
    - TODO: because there is no change 

If the object is a Primitive type




Have some object: {
    var1: Boolean,
    var2: 

}
